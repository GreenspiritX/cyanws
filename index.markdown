# Welcome!

GreenSpirit Productions is a small (mostly one-man) experimental initiative, making games purely for the joy of creation and of accumulating knowledge, delving into design, programming, visual art, and music. A mix of disciplines and varying levels of expertise.

The intention is not to make typical polished projects, instead, the goal with each game is learning one specific discipline or delving into a new idea. Some games might even challenge your definition of "playable." If you're a creative, you know that this is a phase proper to the proces of honing one's skills.
